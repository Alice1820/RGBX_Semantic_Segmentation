# Single Modality Fixmatch (Pseudo-labeling Loss) #
#####################################################################
class FixMatchLoss(torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss):
    r"""This criterion computes the cross entropy loss between input and target.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.
    `input` has to be a Tensor of size :math:`(C)` for unbatched input,
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` for the
    `K`-dimensional case. The last being useful for higher dimension inputs, such
    as computing cross entropy loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    The `target` that this criterion expects should contain either:

    - Class indices in the range :math:`[0, C)` where :math:`C` is the number of classes; if
      `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts this class index (this index
      may not necessarily be in the class range). The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction`
      set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - w_{y_n} \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,y_n})}{\sum_{c=1}^C \exp(x_{n,c})}
          \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n} \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}} l_n, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

      Note that this case is equivalent to the combination of :class:`~torch.nn.LogSoftmax` and
      :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`.

    - Probabilities for each class; useful when labels beyond a single class per minibatch item
      are required, such as for blended labels, label smoothing, etc. The unreduced (i.e. with
      :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,c})}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp(x_{n,i})} y_{n,c}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N l_n}{N}, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

    .. note::
        The performance of this criterion is generally better when `target` contains class
        indices, as this allows for optimized computation. Consider providing `target` as
        class probabilities only when a single class label per minibatch item is too restrictive.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets. Note that
            :attr:`ignore_index` is only applicable when the target contains class indices.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        label_smoothing (float, optional): A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount
            of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets
            become a mixture of the original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in
            `Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`__. Default: :math:`0.0`.
        threshold: A float in [0.0, 1.0], threshold for pseudo-labeling
        T: temperature for psedo-labeling


    Shape:
        - Input: Shape :math:`(C)`, :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: If containing class indices, shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with
          :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss where each value should be between :math:`[0, C)`.
          If containing class probabilities, same shape as the input and each value should be between :math:`[0, 1]`.
        - Output: If reduction is 'none', same shape as the target. Otherwise, scalar.

    Examples::

        >>> # Example of target with class indices
        >>> loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(3, dtype=torch.long).random_(5)
